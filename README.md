# Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc-insights

Codebasics Resume Project challenge -4

## 👋 Introduction
AtliQ Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

## 📑 Problem Statement:
▶ The management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions.

▶ There are 10 ad-hoc requests for which the company needs insights.

▶ Run a SQL Query to answer these requests.

▶ Convert into visualizations and present insights to top-level management

## 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project was originally designed to leverage SQL for handling ad-hoc data requests and Excel/Power BI for creating intuitive data visualizations. However, due to the expiration of my Microsoft license, I adapted the approach and utilized Python to carry out the analysis and visualization tasks—demonstrating flexibility and technical versatility.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL: For querying and exporting relevant data.

NumPy: To read and manipulate CSV files generated from SQL queries.

Matplotlib: For creating clear and insightful data visualizations.

## 📈 Objective:

The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data using structured queries and present them in a visual format to support data-driven decision-making.

This pivot from Excel to Python not only maintained the integrity of the analysis but also provided an opportunity to showcase Python-based data visualization skills.

Let me know if you want to tailor it to a specific dataset, audience (e.g. recruiters, technical teams), or add links/screenshots.
